NAME
    MooseX::AbstractMethod - Declare methods requirements that must be
    satisfied

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use Moose;
        use MooseX::Abstract;

        requires 'bar';

        # synonm to 'requires'
        abstract 'foo';

DESCRIPTION
    This extensions allows classes to flag certain methods as being required
    to be implemented by a subclass, much as a Moose::Role does with
    'requires'.

USAGE
    As in the synopsis, simply mark certain methods as being required by
    subclasses by passing their names to "abstract" or "requires". This will
    cause a method of the same name to be installed in the class that will
    die horribly if it's ever called. Additionally, when a class is made
    immutable, all of its methods are checked to see if they're marked as
    abstract; if any abstract methods exists that were not created in the
    current class, we die horribly.

    Checking for method satisfaction on make_immutable isn't perfect, but
    AFAICT it's the most reasonable approach possible at the moment.
    (Corrections welcome.)
