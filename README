NAME
    MooseX::AbstractMethod - Declare methods requirements that must be
    satisfied

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of MooseX::AbstractMethod -
    released August 31, 2012 as part of MooseX-AbstractMethod.

SYNOPSIS
        use Moose;
        use MooseX::Abstract;

        requires 'bar';

        # synonm to 'requires'
        abstract 'foo';

DESCRIPTION
    This extensions allows classes to flag certain methods as being required
    to be implemented by a subclass, much as a Moose::Role does with
    'requires'.

USAGE
    As in the synopsis, simply mark certain methods as being required by
    subclasses by passing their names to "abstract" or "requires". This will
    cause a method of the same name to be installed in the class that will
    die horribly if it's ever called. Additionally, when a class is made
    immutable, all of its methods are checked to see if they're marked as
    abstract; if any abstract methods exists that were not created in the
    current class, we die horribly.

    Checking for method satisfaction on make_immutable isn't perfect, but
    AFAICT it's the most reasonable approach possible at the moment.
    (Corrections welcome.)

NEW SUGAR
  abstract
    abstract() allows one to declare a method dependency that must be
    satisfied by a subclass before it is invoked, and before the subclass is
    made immutable.

        abstract 'method_name_that_must_be_satisfied';

  requires
    requires() is a synonym for abstract() and works in the way you'd
    expect.
